## Critical Issues to Address

1. **üö® URGENT: Replace app.json**: Current config has development settings that will cause immediate rejection
   - Run: `cp store-assets/production-config.json app.json`
   - Or run: `bash scripts/prepare-for-production.sh`

2. **‚úÖ FIXED: Privacy Policy**: Updated to reference catharisisapp.com/privacy-policy
   - Must be hosted at this exact URL before submission

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Permissions**: Review Android permissions - some may not be justified
   - READ_MEDIA_VIDEO and READ_MEDIA_AUDIO may need removal
   - ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION needs clear justification

4. **üì± Screenshots**: Required for both stores - need to be created
   - iOS: 6.7", 6.5", 5.5", iPad Pro 12.9"
   - Android: Phone + tablet screenshots, feature graphic

5. **üß™ Testing**: Must test on physical devices before submission
